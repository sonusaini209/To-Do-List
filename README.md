  <em>A lightweight to-do list with AI-powered agent interface using fallback pattern matching.<br />
  Dual-mode interaction with full parity: manual UI and natural language commands.</em>
</p>

## ‚ú® Overview

This project was developed for the **Foyr AI Hackathon 2025**, aiming to build **agentic design intelligence** tools that blend a traditional UI with AI agent control.

Users can manage tasks by:

- Manual interaction through a simple UI  
- Natural language commands sent to an AI agent powered by fallback regex matching (no external LLMs required)  
- Viewing conversation history to maintain context
